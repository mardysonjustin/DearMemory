# Dear Memory  
_A simple photobooth web app for capturing and treasuring your special moments._ Unlike typical photo apps that let you upload from your gallery, Dear Memory encourages spontaneity. The app is about **capturing real-time experiences**. Because memories matter more when they’re made in the present.  

## Overview
